# IMPORTANT
I am not working on GLCraft anymore. If you would like to work on it, feel free to fork it!
On the infdev branch, you can see the plethora of code changes I made to attempt to add infinite worlds. However, this codebase is so bad that I gave up on it about a year ago and never came back to it. So, I've reverted the master branch to before the infinite world.

The project will still be worked on periodically [here](https://github.com/spike11302000/GLCraft)!

# GLCraft ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codepixl/GLCraft/master/src/main/resources/textures/icons/icon32.png)
Just testing my skills to see if I can make a voxel game. I'm not planning to do anything with it.

Take a look at the wiki to see how you can make your own plugins for GLCraft.

# Todo

There are a lot of things I am planning to add to do with GLCraft.

Crossed out items means they are completed.

Italic means half completed.

* *Plugin API*

  * ~~Subclasses like GUIButton, GUITextField, GUIImage, etc~~
* ~~Lighting~~
 * ~~Day and night cycle~~
* *Weather*
* Infinite world
* ~~2x2 Crafting System~~
* ~~3x3 Crafting System~~
* ~~Re-add multiplayer~~
* User accounts
