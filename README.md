# GLCraft ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codepixl/GLCraft/master/res/textures/icons/icon32.png)
Just testing my skills to see if I can make a voxel game. I'm not planning to do anything with it.

Main website here: http://www.codepixl.net/GLCraft

Take a look at the wiki to see how you can make your own plugins for GLCraft.

# Todo

There are a lot of things I am planning to add to do with GLCraft.

* Plugin API - kinda finished
* Lighting - I worked on it a while ago but due to all of the bugs I stopped.
* Infinite world
* Crafting System
* Re-add multiplayer
* User accounts
* Animals/Monsters
* Sound
* Better menu
* Options menu
* Tile entities
* Better collision system to allow for custom collision hit boxes
* Make placing blocks actually work
* Much, much more!
