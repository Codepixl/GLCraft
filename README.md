Just testing my skills to see if I can make a voxel game. I'm not planning to do anything with it.

Take a look at the wiki to see how you can make your own plugins for GLCraft.

# Todo

There are a lot of things I am planning to add to do with GLCraft.

Crossed out items means they are completed.

Italic means half completed.

* *Plugin API*
* ~~Better GUI System~~
 * ~~A GUI manager to make showing and hiding GUIs easier~~
 * ~~A GUIScreen class to make building guis easier~~
  * *Subclasses like ~~GUIButton~~, ~~GUITextField~~, ~~GUIImage~~, etc*
* ~~Lighting~~
 * ~~Day and night cycle~~
* Infinite world
* ~~2x2 Crafting System~~
* ~~3x3 Crafting System~~
* Re-add multiplayer
* User accounts
* *Animals/Monsters*
* *Sound*
* ~~Better menu~~
* *Options menu*
* ~~Tile entities~~
* *Better collision system to allow for custom collision hit boxes*
* ~~Make placing blocks actually work~~
* ~~Saving and Loading worlds~~
* Much, much more!
